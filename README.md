# Visualizaciones

Ridgeline plots are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range. They can be quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space.

This is an implementation of ggridges package to show the distribution of the temperature in Vitoria, Spain during 2020.

This work is based on Introduction to ggridges by Claus O. Wike (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html)
